 * mdnsd - embeddable Multicast DNS Daemon
 * =======================================
 *
 * "mdnsd" is a very lightweight, simple, portable, and easy to integrate
 * open source implementation of Multicast DNS (part of Zeroconf, also called
 * Rendezvous by Apple) for developers. It supports both acting as a Query and
 * a Responder, allowing any software to participate fully on the .localnetwork
 * just by including a few files and calling a few functions.  All of the
 * complexity of handling the Multicast DNS retransmit timing, duplicate
 * suppression, probing, conflict detection, and other facets of the DNS
 * protocol is hidden behind a very simple and very easy to use interface,
 * described in the header file. The single small c source file has almost no
 * dependencies, and is portable to almost any embedded platform.
 * Multiple example applications and usages are included in the download,
 * including a simple persistent query browser and a tool to advertise .local
 * web sites.
 *
 * The code is licensed under both the GPL and BSD licenses, for use in any
 * free software or commercial application. If there is a licensing need not
 * covered by either of those, alternative licensing is available upon request.
